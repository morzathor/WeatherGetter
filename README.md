# Weather forecast in your Terminal !

This is part of my **Newbie** collection which I'm just making it work, no AI, no copy-paste code, simply code what I think and learned so far.

#### If you have _Free_-time and you are _Free_-spirited, feel _Free_ to reach me to point out my problems / issues and advice me on fixes / optimizations. 

Written in Python, it uses [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) to fetch weather forecast of given location (latitude and longitude).

It supports
- Daily forecast
- Hourly forecast
- Current forecast

## Usage
1.Clone or download the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/morzathor/WeatherGetter.git
```
2.Run the script:
```
Python3 ~/Path-to-file/main.py
```
3.Set your longitude and latitude first,which lasts untill application is running (default coordinates are for Seoul).

4.Enjoy!
